# esgpull - ESGF data management utility

`esgpull` is a tool that simplifies usage of the [ESGF Search API](https://esgf.github.io/esg-search/ESGF_Search_RESTful_API.html) for data discovery, and manages procedures related to downloading and storing files from ESGF.

```py
from esgpull import Esgpull, Query

query = Query()
query.selection.project = "CMIP6"
query.options.distrib = True  # default=False
esg = Esgpull()
nb_datasets = esg.context.hits(query, file=False)[0]
nb_files = esg.context.hits(query, file=True)[0]
datasets = esg.context.datasets(query, max_hits=5)
print(f"Number of CMIP6 datasets: {nb_datasets}")
print(f"Number of CMIP6 files: {nb_files}")
for dataset in datasets:
    print(dataset)
```
