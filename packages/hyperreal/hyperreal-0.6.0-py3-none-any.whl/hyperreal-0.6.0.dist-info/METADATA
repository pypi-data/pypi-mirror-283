           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# About #

# About

Hyperreal is a Python tool for interactive qualitative analysis of large
collections of documents. Hyperreal builds on ideas from topic modelling, corpus linguistics and full text search. The aim is to enable new kinds of qualitative analysis workflows for amounts of data that would otherwise be too big to approach using existing approaches. It is designed to work with very large collections with only modest resources: interactive performance is always a development priority. 

This library allows you to take a large collection of documents such as the 55 million questions and answers from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and:

1. Create a searchable index of the content across many different fields, allowing you pay attention to the different ways a complex platform can be used.
2. Use a text analytics algorithm to create an exploratory structure (simple clusters of features) for understanding this large dataset in context.
3. Use the software and web interface to interactively query and display matching documents and parts of documents for each of the individual feature clusters.
4. Edit the resulting clusters of features to begin addressing your research question by aligning your reading of the content with the query used to retrieve it.

Hyperreal aims to enables fine grained control over how documents are indexed, and, unlike other libraries, enables fine-grained control over how they are *displayed* in different contexts. Reading documents in context is a core concern.

See [A Recent History of Python Through Stack Overflow Questions and Answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scpjoqtgrtE) for an overview of how this can be used in practise.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Hyperreal requires the installation of [the Python programming language](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Hyperreal can be installed using Pip from the command line (
[Windows](https://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-windows-shell/introduction/introduction/#windows-command-shell),
[Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac))
by running the following commands:

```
python -m pip install hyperreal
```

### Usage

Hyperreal can be used in three different ways to flexibly support different
use cases:

- as a command line application
- as a Python library
- as a local web application

All of hyperreal's functionality is available from the Python library, but you
will need to write Python code to use it directly. The command line interface
allows for quick and repeatable experimentation and automation for standard
data types - for example if you often work with StackExchange data the command line
will allow you to rapidly work with many different StackExchange data collections.
The web application is currently focused solely on creating and interactive
editing of models built on top of existing indexes.


### Command Line

The following script gives a basic example of using the command line interface
for hyperreal. This will work for cases where you have a plain text file
(here called `corpus.txt`), with each `document` in the collection on its own
line.

If you haven't worked with the command line before, you might find the
following resources useful:

- [Software Carpentry resources for Mac](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [Open Water Foundation resources for Windows](https://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-windows-shell/)

```
# Create a corpus database from a plaintext file in the current working directory
hyperreal plaintext-corpus create corpus.txt corpus.db

# Create an index from the corpus
hyperreal plaintext-corpus index corpus.db corpus_index.db

# Create a model from that index, in this case with 128 clusters and
# only include features present in 10 or more documents.
hyperreal model corpus_index.db --min-docs 10 --clusters 128

# Use the web interface to serve the results of that modelling
# After running this command point your web browser to http://localhost:8080
hyperreal plaintext-corpus serve corpus.db corpus_index.db

```

### Library

This example script performs the same steps as the command line example.

```python

from hyperreal import corpus, index

# create and populate the corpus with some documents
c = corpus.PlainTextSqliteCorpus('corpus.db')

with open('corpus.txt', 'r') as f:
  # This will drop any line that has no text (such as a paragraph break)
  docs = (line for line in f if line.strip())
  c.replace_docs(docs)


# Index that corpus - note that we need to pass the corpus object for
# initialisation.
idx = index.Index('corpus_index.db', corpus=c)
# This only needs to be done once, unless the corpus changes.
idx.rebuild()

# Create a model on this index, with 128 clusters and only including features
# that match at least 10 documents.
idx.initialise_clusters(n_clusters=128, min_docs=10)
# Refine the model for 10 iterations. Note that you can continue to refine
# the model without initialising the clusters.
idx.refine_clusters(iterations=10)

# Inspect the output of the model using the index instance (currently quite
# limited). This will print the top 10 most frequent features in each
# cluster.
for cluster_id in idx.cluster_ids:
    cluster_features = idx.cluster_features(cluster_id)
    for feature in cluster_features[:10]:
        print(feature)

# Perform a boolean query on the corpus, looking for documents that contain
# both apples AND oranges in the text field.
q = i[('text', 'apples')] & i[('text', 'oranges')]
# Lookup all of the documents in the corpus that match this query.
docs = idx.get_docs(q)

# 'Pivot' the features in the index with respect to all cluster in the model.
#  This will show the top 10 features in each cluster that are similar to the
#  query.
for cluster_detail in idx.pivot_clusters_by_query(query, top_k=10):
    print(cluster_detail)

# This will show the top 10 features for a selected set of cluster_ids.
for cluster_detail in idx.pivot_clusters_by_query(query, cluster_ids=[3,5,7], top_k=10):
    print(cluster_detail)

```
