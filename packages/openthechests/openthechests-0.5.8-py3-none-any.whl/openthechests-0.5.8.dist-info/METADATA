# Open The Chests Project

Open the Chests is a game that mimics the problem of situation recognition in a concurrent event-based environment.
The player is confronted with a number of boxes, each one associated with a button. Pressing a button sometimes leads 
to a box opening, sometimes leads to nothing. The player also observes events being displayed on a screen.
The goal of the player is to deduce a set of interpretable event-based rules that allow them to determine with confidence 
at which moment the chests can be opened.

## Quick Start

To install Open-the-Chests and all its libraries simply run:
```shell
pip install openthechests
```
The environment is then ready to execute by simply running the `demo.py` file.

## Running the Demo
The execution of the demo file generates an environment using a `YAML` configuration
file and allows you to interact with the environment manually.
To run the demo, use the following command:
```shell
python demo.py
```
This will initialize the environment and start the interactive session where you can input actions to interact with the boxes.
