  description: "Headphones required. Participants that complete the survey and correctly answer the attention-check questions will receive $3.50 ($0.50 on accept; $3.00 bonus) through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Estimated 15 minutes ($14 / hour).

You are invited to take part in Northwestern University research study - STU00216820 Evaluation of the quality of audio generation and modification algorithms, headed by Principal Investigator Prof. Bryan Pardo.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of the output of computer algorithms designed to modify or generate speech or music. If you participate, you will be asked to complete a consent form and then take a survey. In the survey, you will listen to a series of audio examples and rate or compare them. A small number of questions in the survey are very easy attention checks with obvious correct answers. We expect it will take roughly 15 minutes to complete the survey. Participants that complete the survey and correctly answer the attention-check questions will receive $3.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk.

  ### **Consent to Participate in Research**
\n##### **Title of Research Study:**  Evaluation of the quality of audio generation and modification algorithms
\n##### **Principal Investigator:** Bryan Pardo
\n##### **Supported By:** This research is supported by the Northwestern University Computer Science Department.
\n##### **Key Information about this research study:**
\n\n* ##### The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of the output of algorithms designed to modify or generate speech or music.
\n* ##### You will be asked to take a survey where you will listen to a series of audio examples and rate or compare them. A small number of questions in the survey will be very easy attention checks with obvious correct answers. The remainder of the questions will be more difficult.
\n* ##### We expect that it will take you roughly 15 minutes to complete this study.
\n* ##### The primary potential risk of participation is boredom.
\n* ##### There is no intrinsic benefit to you from completing this study.
\n* ##### Participants that complete the study and that correctly answer the attention-check questions will receive $3.50.

\n ##### **Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?**
\n ##### We are asking you to take part in this research study because we are interested in the opinions of members of the general public about the sonic quality of the output of our algorithms. Any resident of the United States of America that is at least 18 years of age is eligible to take part.
\n ##### **How many people will be in this study?**
\n ##### We expect about 30 people will be in this research study.
\n ##### **What should I know about participating in a research study?**
\n\n* ##### Whether or not you take part is up to you.
\n* ##### You can choose not to take part.
\n* ##### You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
\n* ##### Your decision will not be held against you.
\n* ##### You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.
\n* ##### You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.

\n ##### **What happens if I say, “Yes, I want to be in this research”?**
\n ##### You will first be presented a two-question listening test where you're presented a series of tones and asked to report how many tones you hear. You will then be asked a series of multiple-choice questions where you are asked to evaluate audio files that are presented to you with each question. You will then be asked about your listening environment. We will then provide you a code number you can use to be reimbursed for your time through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The entire process should take roughly 15 minutes.
\n ##### **Will being in this study help me in any way?**
\n ##### We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research.
\n ##### **Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?**
\n ##### We do not forsee any risks from participating in this study.
\n ##### **What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my mind later?**
\n ##### Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate.  If you do not want to be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University/Northwestern Memorial Healthcare. You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. If you decide to withdraw from this study, any data already collected from you will be destroyed.
\n ##### **How will the researchers protect my information?**
\n ##### We will collect no personally identifiable information beyond your Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID, which is necessary for paying you. Once you have been paid, we will delete this information from our records. All responses will be stored on a password protected server.
\n ##### **Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?**
\n ##### Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.
There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or after this study. Examples include:
\n\n *	##### University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.
\n ##### **How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?**
\n ##### We will not have access to any personally identifiable information beyond your Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID. We will delete your worker ID from our records, once you have been paid. De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for research.
\n ##### **Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?**
\n ##### A small number of questions in the survey will be very easy attention-checks with obvious correct answers. You will receive $3.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk for your participation in this study if you complete the survey and correctly answer the attention checks. You will receive $.50 if you incorrectly answer the listening test or attention checks.
\n ##### **Who can I talk to?**
\n ##### If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, you can contact the Principal Investigator Bryan Pardo by calling 847-491-7184 or by emailing  pardo@northwestern.edu. Please put “MTurk Study” in the subject line of the email to ensure a speedy reply.

survey_instructions: "
  ## **Instructions** \nListen to all recordings of a person speaking. Then, move the sliders
  to **rate the quality of each audio file from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)**. The
  higher-quality audio files are the ones that are more natural sounding, or
  have fewer audio artifacts (e.g., clicks, pops, noise, or otherwise sound 'unnatural').
  **Note** - Each slider cannot be moved until its corresponding audio file has been listened to in its entirety."
