FMUTool is a python application which help to modify a Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) 
without recompilation. It mainly modifies the `modelDescription.xml` file. It is highly customizable.

Manipulating the `modelDescription.xml` can be a dangerous thing! Communicating with the FMU-developer and adapting
the way the FMU is generated, is the preferable when possible.
