## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install skyscanner-b2b
```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The SkyscannerB2b API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```py
SkyscannerB2b(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER"
)
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER")
```

## Services

The SDK provides various services to interact with the API.
