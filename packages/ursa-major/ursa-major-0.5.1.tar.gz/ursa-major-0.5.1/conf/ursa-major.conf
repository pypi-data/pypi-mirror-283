# If specified, set the default tags_from for each buildroot tag.
# The values is a list seperated by ','.
# about `tags_from`:
# - It is an array of glob patterns. If any tag of a module build matches any
#   pattern there, it is admitted.
# - None means no limit to the tags of a module build, which is the same as the
#   old behavior. This is the same as undefined.
# - If a module build without any tags is explicitly expected, set it to [].
