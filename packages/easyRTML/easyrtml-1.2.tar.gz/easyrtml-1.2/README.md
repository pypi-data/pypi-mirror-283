# easyRTML

## Overview

`easyRTML` is a comprehensive Python package designed for signal classification and deployment on microcontroller boards. This package simplifies the process of signal processing and model deployment, enabling users to leverage advanced technology without requiring specialized expertise.

## Features

- **Signal Classification**: Efficient tools for preprocessing and classifying signals.
- **Microcontroller Deployment**: Seamless generation and deployment of models on various microcontroller boards.
- **Feature Extraction**: Advanced techniques for extracting meaningful features from signal data.
- **Model Handling**: Robust integration with XGBoost for model training and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Built-in support for visualizing data and model performance.

## Installation

To install `easyRTML`, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher. You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install easyRTML

Usage
Here's a quick example to get started with easyRTML:

Data Acquisition: Record data from a serial port:

python
Copy code
from easyRTML import dataaq

filename = "data.csv"
baud_rate = 9600
serial_port = "/dev/tty.usbserial-0001"
dataaq.record_data(filename, serial_port, baud_rate)
Feature Extraction and Shuffling: Process the recorded data:

python
Copy code
from easyRTML import tdfx, shuffle_dataframe

sampling_freq = 273
mean_gesture_duration = 1000
shift = 0.3
features_df, variables = tdfx(filename, sampling_freq, mean_gesture_duration, shift)
shuffled_df = shuffle_dataframe(features_df)
Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate a model using XGBoost:

python
Copy code
from easyRTML import train_model

model = train_model(shuffled_df)
