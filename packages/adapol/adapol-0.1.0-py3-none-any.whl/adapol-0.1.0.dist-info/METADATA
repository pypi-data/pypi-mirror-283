# adapol: Adaptive Pole Fitting for Quantum Many-Body Physics
[`adapol`](https://github.com/Hertz4/Adapol) (pronounced "add a pole") is a python package for fitting Matsubara functions with the following form:
```math
G(\mathrm i \omega_k) = \sum_l \frac{V_lV_l^{\dagger}}{\mathrm i\omega_k - E_l}.
```

Current applications include
(1) hybridization fitting, (2) analytic continuation.

We also provide a [TRIQS](https://triqs.github.io/) interface if the Matsubara functions are stored in `triqs` Green's function container.

# Installation
`adapol` has `numpy` and `scipy` as its prerequisites. [`cvxpy`](https://www.cvxpy.org/) is also required for hybridization fitting of matrix-valued (instead of scalar-valued) Matsubara functions.

To install `adapol`, run
```terminal
pip install adapol
```



# Documentation

See the detailed [documentation](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/adapol/) for physical background, algorithms and user manual.

`Adapol` is a stand-alone package. For TRIQS users, we also provide a TRIQS interface. See [user manual](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/adapol/latest/python.html#triqs-interface) for details.

# Examples
In the `tutorial` page, we provide two examples [`discrete.ipynb`](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/adapol/latest/tutorials/discrete.html) and [`semicircle.ipynb`](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/adapol/latest/tutorials/semicircle.html), showcasing how to use `adapol` for both discrete spectrum and continuous spectrum.

In these notebooks, we also demonstrate how to use our code through the triqs interface.
