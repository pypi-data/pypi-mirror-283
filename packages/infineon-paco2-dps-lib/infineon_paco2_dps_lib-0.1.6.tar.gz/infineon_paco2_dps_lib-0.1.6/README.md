## Installation

To install the library, you can use `pip`. If the package is published on PyPI, you can install it directly from there:

```bash
pip install infineon_paco2_dps_lib
```

If you are installing it from a local source, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Reading Temperature and Pressure from DPS310

The `DPS` class allows you to interface with the Infineon DPS310 pressure sensor. Here is an example of how to use it to read temperature and pressure data:

```python
from infineon_paco2_dps_lib import dps

def main():
    # Initialize the dps sensor
    dps = dps()

    # Read temperature
    temperature = dps.read_temperature()
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} °C")

    # Read pressure
    pressure = dps.read_pressure()
    print(f"Pressure: {pressure:.2f} Pa")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Measuring CO2 with PA_CO2

The `paco2` class allows you to interface with the Infineon PA_CO2 sensor. Here is an example of how to use it to measure CO2 concentration:

```python
from infineon_paco2_dps_lib import paco2

def main():
    # Initialize the pa_co2 sensor
    sensor = paco2()

    # Measure CO2 concentration
    co2_concentration = sensor.measure_co2()
    print(f"CO2 Concentration: {co2_concentration:.2f} ppm")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


```

## API Reference

### dps Class

The `dps` class provides methods to interface with the Infineon DPS310 pressure sensor. This class supports reading temperature and pressure data.

#### Initialization

```python
dps = dps()
```

This initializes the DPS sensor by setting up the I2C bus and configuring the sensor.

#### Methods

- `read_temperature()`: Reads and returns the temperature in degrees Celsius.

  ```python
  temperature = dps.read_temperature()
  ```

- `read_pressure()`: Reads and returns the pressure in Pascals.

  ```python
  pressure = dps.read_pressure()
  ```

### paco2 Class

The `paco2` class provides methods to interface with the Infineon PA_CO2 sensor. This class supports measuring CO2 concentration.

#### Initialization

```python
co2_sensor = paco2()
```

This initializes the PA_CO2 sensor by setting up the I2C bus and configuring the sensor.

#### Methods

- `measure_co2()`: Triggers a CO2 measurement and returns the CO2 concentration in parts per million (ppm).

  ```python
  co2_ppm = co2_sensor.measure_co2()
  ```

## Detailed Library Overview

The **infineon_paco2_dps_lib** library is designed to facilitate easy interaction with Infineon’s PA_CO2 and DPS sensors using the I2C protocol. The library abstracts the complexity involved in sensor communication, providing straightforward methods to retrieve sensor data.

### DPS Sensor

The DPS310 is a high-precision pressure sensor capable of measuring temperature and pressure. It is commonly used in applications such as weather stations, altimeters, and other environmental monitoring systems. The dps class in this library provides methods to initialize the sensor, configure its settings, and read data.

#### Temperature and Pressure Measurement

The DPS310 sensor uses advanced calibration algorithms to ensure accurate readings. The `read_temperature` method retrieves the temperature by reading raw sensor data, scaling it, and applying calibration coefficients. Similarly, the `read_pressure` method processes raw pressure data to provide precise measurements.

### PA_CO2 Sensor

The PA_CO2 sensor measures CO2 concentration in the environment. It is useful in applications such as indoor air quality monitoring, HVAC systems, and industrial safety.

#### CO2 Measurement

The `measure_co2` method triggers the sensor to perform a CO2 concentration measurement. It reads raw data from the sensor, processes it, and returns the CO2 level in parts per million (ppm). This method ensures reliable and accurate CO2 monitoring for various applications.
