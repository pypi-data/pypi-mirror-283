        :param notification_type: The type of the notification to be sent,
            such as, for example, ``on_something_happened``.

        :param recipient_ids: The identifier of a recipient, or a list of
            identifiers of recipients, to send the notification to.

        :param content_text: The text (second row) of the notification, in a
            standard notification.  It corresponds to the localized text that
            provides the notificationâ€™s main content.

        :param content_title: The title (first row) of the notification, in a
            standard notification.  It corresponds to the localized text that
            provides the notificationâ€™s primary description.

        :param is_priority: There are two options for assigning delivery
            priority to downstream messages: normal and high priority.  Though
            the behavior differs slightly across platforms, delivery of normal
            and high priority messages works as follows:

            - Normal priority. Normal priority messages are delivered immediately
              when the app is in the foreground.  For background apps running in
              the background, delivery may be delayed.  For less time-sensitive
              messages, such as notifications of new email, keeping UI in sync, or
              syncing app data in the background, choose normal delivery priority.

            - High priority. The messaging system attempts to deliver high priority
              messages immediately even if the device is in Doze mode. High priority
              messages are for time-sensitive, user visible content.

        :param notification_id: The unique identifier of the notification.

        :param payload: Any arbitrary JSON expression that provides
            information about the context of this notification.

        :param sound: The sound that plays when the device receives the
            notification.  Supports ``default`` or the filename of a sound
            resource bundled in your app.  Sound files must reside in
            ``/res/raw/``.
