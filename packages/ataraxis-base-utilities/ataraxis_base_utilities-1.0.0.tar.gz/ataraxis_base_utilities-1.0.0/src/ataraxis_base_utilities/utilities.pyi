class Console:
    """Provides methods for configuring and using loguru-based pipelines that generate, display and log information
    and error messages.

    This class functions as a centralized API used by all project Ataraxis modules that abstracts module-console
    interactions. The use of a dedicated class (and library) to control messaging functionality allows any Ataraxis
    module to naturally integrate with the rest of the project. Additionally, decoupling message pipeline
    implementation from module's source code allows more flexibility when developing our messaging standards and APIs.

    Args:
        logger_backend: Specifies the backend used to manage terminal and file logs. Valid values are available through
            LogBackends enumeration and are currently limited to LOGURU and CLICK. Defaults to LOGURU.
        line_width: The maximum number of characters in a single line of displayed text. This is primarily used to
            limit the width of the text block as it is displayed in the terminal and saved to log files. Defaults to
            120.
        message_log_path: The path to the file used to log non-error messages (info to warning levels). If not provided
            (set to None), logging non-error messages will be disabled. Defaults to None.
        error_log_path: The path to the file used to log error messages (error and critical levels). If not provided
            (set to None), logging non-error messages will be disabled. Defaults to None.
        debug_log_path: The path to the file used to log debug messages (detail levels vary). If not provided
            (set to None), logging non-error messages will be disabled. Defaults to None.
        break_long_words: Determines whether long words can be broken-up when then text block is
            formatted to fit the width requirement. Defaults to False.
        break_on_hyphens: determines whether breaking sentences on hyphens is allowed when text
            block is formatted to fit the width requirement. Defaults to False.
        use_color: Determines whether terminal output should be colorized. Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        _line_width: Stores the maximum allowed text block width, in characters.
        _break_long_words: Determines whether to break text on long words.
        _break_on_hyphens: Determines whether to break text on hyphens.
        _use_color: Determines whether to colorize terminal output.
        _message_log_path: Stores the path to the message log file.
        _error_log_path: Stores the path to the error log file.
        _debug_log_path: Stores the path to the debug log file.
        _backend: Tracks logger backends used by the console class.
        _logger: When logging backend is set to LOGURU, stores the instance of the loguru 'Logger' class used to manage
            the logs. Otherwise, it is to None.
        _is_enabled: Tracks whether logging through this class instance is enabled or disabled. Initializes to False.

        This enforces the necessary formatting and, overall, is a prerequisite to use the loguru backend to
        display messages. This method only needs to be called once, preferably from the top of the call hierarchy, for
        interactive libraries. Do not call this method from API runtimes to avoid interfering with upstream processes
        instantiating their own handles.

        Notes:
            The method can be flexibly configured to only add a subset of all supported handles. For example,
            by default, it does not add debug handles, making it impossible to display or log debug messages. It can
            also be configured to not remove existing handles (default behavior) if necessary. See argument docstrings
            below for more information.

            During runtime, handles determine what happens to the message passed via appropriate 'log' call. Loguru
            shares the set of handles across all 'logger' instances, which means this method should be used with
            caution, as it can interfere with any other handles, including the default ones.

        Args:
            remove_existing_handles: Determines whether to remove all existing handles before adding new loguru handles.
                Defaults to True.
            debug_terminal: Determines whether to add the handle that prints debug-level messages to terminal.
            debug_file: Determines whether to add the handle that writes debug-level messages to log file.
            message_terminal: Same as debug_terminal, but for information, success and warning level messages.
            message_file: Same as debug_file, but for information, success and warning level messages.
            error_terminal: Same as debug_terminal, but for error and critical level messages.
            error_file: Same as debug_file, but for error and critical level messages.
            enqueue: Determines if messages are processed synchronously or asynchronously. Generally, this option is
                only suggested for multiprocessing runtimes that log data from multiple processes, as queueing messages
                prevents race conditions and other unsafe operations.
