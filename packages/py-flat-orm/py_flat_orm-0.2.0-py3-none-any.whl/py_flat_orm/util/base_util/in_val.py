# Python does not make a field int by doing e.g. `age: int`. Without assignment, the field is not even present
# The only reliable way to make a field int is by setting a value to it
# This allows type checking, e.g.
# if age is 0, isinstance(person.age, int) returns True
# if age is None, isinstance(person.age, int) returns False
