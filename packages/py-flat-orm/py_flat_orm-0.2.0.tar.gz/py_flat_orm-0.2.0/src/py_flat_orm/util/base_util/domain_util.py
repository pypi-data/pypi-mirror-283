        """
        Merge data submitted from the client side to the server side, which allows submitting only a single field to update one field using the API, without having to submit every single field.

        Used by Domain.mergeData(), so that setting data is consistently handled.
        This develops a consistent procedure, so that devs don't need to always consider if they need to use
        - e.g.`this.myField = myField` - set the value without fallback
        - or`this.myField = myField ?: this.myField` - picks up the db value if value supplied is null

        Scenarios:
        - if user intentionally sets value x, and resolved as x, use x
        - if user intentionally sets value x, and resolved as y, use y
        - if user intentionally sets value null, and resolved as y, use y
        - if user intentionally sets value null, and resolved as null, use null
        - if user does not submit field (no intent to change), and resolved as null (because a variable is created to process the logic), use db value
          - mostly occurs when using the API to update without supplying every single field
