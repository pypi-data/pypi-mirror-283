## How to install

This package is available on PyPI and can be installed with pipx:

```bash
brew install pipx
pipx install safari-to-sqlite
```

## Usage

To save your Safari tabs to a SQLite database, run:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite
```

This will save the tabs to a file called `safari-tabs.db` in your current directory.

Or to specify a database file:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite tabs.db
```

## Authentication
Cross device sync is possible using a [Turso](https://turso.tech) account. 
You can configure your own database or allow this tool to automatically perform setup for you.
To authenticate, run:

```bash
safari-to-sqlite auth
```

If you don't have an existing Turso account or database, no problem!
This command will walk you through the setup process by installing the Turso CLI with brew and creating a new database for you.
Otherwise, you can manually enter your own database URL and token.

## Roadmap to 0.2
- Add scraping for when full page content is missing from Safari
