# Introduction

Waverider Generator is a python package which can be used to generate hypersonic waveriders based on an efficient parametrisation described in [1].
The method makes use of the oscultating cone inverse design method and four design parameters `X1`, `X2`, `X3` and `X4`. 
Please consult the paper referenced for any further clarification on the geometrical meaning of these inputs.

## Coordinate System
The coordinate system is defined such that:
- $x$ is the streamwise direction
- $y$ is the transverse direction
- $z$ is the spanwise direction

with the origin at the tip of the waverider.

## Flow Field

### Oblique Shock
In the flat region of the shockwave, the lower surface is determined via the $\theta$- $\beta$ - $M_{\infty}$ equation, which relates the deflection angle $\theta$ to the shock angle $\beta$ in an oblique shock. 

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{2 \cot\left(\beta\right) \left(M_{\infty}^2 \sin^2\left(\beta \right) - 1\right)}{M_{\infty}^2 (\gamma + \cos\left(2 \beta\right)) + 2}
$$

Where $\gamma=1.4$ is the ratio of specific heats for air and $M_{\infty}$ is the freestream Mach number.

### Osculating Cone Theory

In the curved region of the shockwave, the osculating cone theory is used whereby conical flow is locally applied at each osculating plane. 
The Taylor-Maccoll ODE, which describes conical flow, is solved and the resulting streamlines are propagated until the back of the waverider is reached to produce the lower surface.
See [2] for more information on the Osculating Cone Theory.

## Required Inputs
- Design parameters `X1`, `X2`, `X3` and `X4`. Note this is entered as a list `dp` of four elements where the parameters are organised in the order listed here. Refer to the examples.
- Freestream Mach number `M_inf`.
- Shock angle in degrees `beta`.
- Height of the waverider at the base plane `height`. Note that the length of the waverider is determined as $height/\tan(\beta)$ so a user may choose to determine the height required for a desired length.
- Width of the waverider `width`. Note that this refers to half of the total width of the waverider due to the symmetry.
- Number of points to be used for interpolating the shockwave and the upper surface curve (`n_shockwave` and `n_upper_surface` respectively). Both are integers greater than 10 to preserve quality.
## Optional Inputs
- Number of osculating planes used in the generation of the geometry `n_planes`. Note that this doesn't include the symmetry plane and the tip. A minimum number of planes is set at 10 to preserve quality and this is the default value.
- Number of points in the streamwise direction for the generation of the upper surface as well as the flat part of the shockwave on the lower surface `n_streamwise`. A minimum is set at 10 to preserve quality and this is the default value.
- Maximum step to be used in the tracing of the streamlines for the lower surface `delta_streamwise`. Note this is entered as a percentage of the length of the waverider and a maximum is set at 20% to preserve quality. The default value is 5%.

# Usage and functionality

A user can create a `waverider` instance by importing the `waverider` class from `waverider_generator.generator`. Everything takes place inside the class constructor so the user only needs to initialise the instance to create the geometry. An example is shown below: <br>
```python
from waverider_generator.generator import waverider as wr
M_inf=5
beta=15
height=1.34
width=3
dp=[0.11,0.63,0,0.46]
n_planes=20
n_streamwise=10
delta_streamwise=0.1
waverider=wr(M_inf=M_inf,beta=beta,height=height,width=width,dp=dp,n_upper_surface=10000,n_shockwave=10000,n_planes=n_planes,n_streamwise=n_streamwise,delta_streamise=delta_streamwise)
```
## CAD Export
To export the geometry into a file CAD, the user can import the `to_CAD` function from `waverider_generator.cad_export`. An example is shown below: <br>

```python
#%%
# assuming a waverider instance has been created with the code above
from waverider_generator.cad_export import to_CAD

waverider_cad=to_CAD(waverider=waverider,sides='both',export=True,filename='waverider.step',scale=1000)
waverider_cad
```

The `to_CAD` function is detailed below:

|Input|Type|Conditions|Description|
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| `waverider` | `waverider` | NA|`waverider` instance|
| `sides`| `str` | `"left"`, `"right"` or `"both"` <br> | Side(s) of the waverider to generate in the CAD|
|`export`| `bool` |`True` or `False`| Setting this to `True` exports the CAD to the current directory, `False` does not|
|`filename`| `str`| The extension must be one which `cadquery` can generate a CAD file in| Name of the CAD file to be created|
|`scale` (optional)|`float`,`int`| `scale>0`| Scale factor by which the final geometry is scaled. By default, cadquery exports geometries in mm so the default value for `scale` is 1000 to obtain dimensions in meters. Setting this to 1 keeps the dimensions in mm. It is recommended to keep the default value of 1000 and work in meters from the start.

|Output|Type|Conditions|Description|
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
`waverider_cad`| `cq.Solid` (cadquery solid) | NA | A cadquery solid corresponding to the waverider generated. This can be previewed in a Jupyter Notebook, therefore avoiding the step of exporting and importing into a seperate CAD software each time.|

## Plotting tools

The package also allows the user to plot basic figures to analyse the geometry generated before a CAD export. This is done by importing `Plot_Base_Plane` and `Plot_Leading_Edge` from `waverider_generator.plotting_tools`. An example, also included as an example file, is shown below

**Note** that the `latex` input into the plotting functions is a boolean and determines whether or not to plot the figure with the default LaTex font. The user is required to install a LaTex distribution on their system for this feature to work.

```python
#%%
from waverider_generator.generator import waverider as wr
from waverider_generator.plotting_tools import Plot_Base_Plane,Plot_Leading_Edge
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

M_inf=5
beta=15
height=1.34
width=3
dp=[0.11,0.63,0,0.46]
n_planes=20
n_streamwise=10
delta_streamwise=0.1
waverider=wr(M_inf=M_inf,beta=beta,height=height,width=width,dp=dp,n_upper_surface=10000,n_shockwave=10000,n_planes=n_planes,n_streamwise=n_streamwise,delta_streamise=delta_streamwise)
#%%
'''
PLOT BASE PLANE
'''
base_plane=Plot_Base_Plane(waverider=waverider,latex=True)
#%%
'''
PLOT LEADING EDGE
'''
leading_edge=Plot_Leading_Edge(waverider=waverider=True,latex=True)
plt.show()
```
