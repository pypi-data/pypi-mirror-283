    Remove the usage of the Eventlet debug feature from oslo.log
    Then hub_prevent_multiple_readers is a debug convenience. This
    feature is a debug convenience. The problem with disabling this
    procedure is that `it exposes you to risks <https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/eventlet.html#eventlet.debug.hub_prevent_multiple_readers>`_.
    Deactivation applies to the entire stack. If a project uses oslo.log,
    for example nova, then it exposes all threads to concurrent access on
    the process file descriptors. When several greenlets are reading from
    the same socket, it's difficult to predict which greenlet will receive
    which data. That services using oslo.log should prefer using tpool
    rather than un-monkey patched version of stdlib threading module which
    is not compatible with eventlet.
