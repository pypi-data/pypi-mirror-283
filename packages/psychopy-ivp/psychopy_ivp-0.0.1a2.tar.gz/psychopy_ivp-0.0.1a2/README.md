### Pellet Dispenser

The Pellet Dispenser component allows one single dispense action in a
routine. By default it starts the dispense action with the component, and
terminate the routine when the dispense action is done. Due to the impredictable
timing of the dispense action (several attempt will be made by the device in
case of jamming), it is preferable to use a routine to the sole purpose of the
dispensing action.

The `examples` directory contains `.psyexp` files that show how you can
integrate the pellet dispenser.
