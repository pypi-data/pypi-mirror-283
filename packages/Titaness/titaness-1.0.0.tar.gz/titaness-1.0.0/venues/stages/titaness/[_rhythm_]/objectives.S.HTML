				[ ] capture process journal:

				[ ] The unit_tests from body_scan
					need to be rewritten as body_scan tests
					for titaness.
					
				[ ]	global option to repeat checks if they fail,
					since there are possibilites like "deadlocks"
				
				[ ] mkdir -p, db_directory
			
				[ ] print the passed checks history numbers in the results.
				
						status checks [113 to 103]: [45][43][43][42][40]

						#
						#	That way can easily notice if that number decreases
						#	suddenly for some reason.
						#	
				
				
				[ ] Somehow showing processes that are still in progress,
					in the event that one doesn't stop ever or something.
				
				[ ]	A way to start multiple globs.			
				
					scan = titaness.start_s2 (
