    image_path = ""  # Replace with the path to your image

    try:
        # Use the recognize_objects method to recognize objects in the image
        decoded_predictions = your_library.recognize_objects(image_path)

        # Use the generate_tags method to generate tags for the recognized objects
        tags = your_library.generate_tags(decoded_predictions)

        print("Recognized objects and tags:")
        for tag in tags:
