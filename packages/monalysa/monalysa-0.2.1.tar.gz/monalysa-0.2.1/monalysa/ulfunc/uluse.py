``uluse.py`` is a module containing different classes, and functions for quantifying
the UL use construct - instantaneous and average use. 

The current version of the module contains the following instantaneous UL use algorithms:

1. Vector magnitude from the Actigraph sensor (with and without hysterisis)
2. GMAC (Gross Movement + Activity Counts)
