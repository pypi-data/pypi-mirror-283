Did you give up on HTTP/2 due to performance concerns? Think again! Do you realize that you can get 2.53 times faster with the same CPU if you ever switched to Niquests from Requests?
Multiplexing and response lazyness open up a wide range of possibilities! Want to learn more about the tests? scripts? reasoning?

async def main() -> None:
    async with niquests.AsyncSession(resolver="doh+google://") as s:
        r = await s.get('https://pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'), stream=True)
        print(r)  # Output: <Response HTTP/3 [200]>
        payload = await r.json()
        print(payload)  # Output: {'authenticated': True, ...}

asyncio.run(main())
```

Niquests allows you to send HTTP requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — just use the `json` method!

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/niquests.svg)](https://pypistats.org/packages/niquests)
[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/niquests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/niquests)

This project does not require any compilation toolchain. The HTTP/3 support is not enforced and installed if your platform can support it natively _(e.g. pre-built wheel available)_.

## ✨ Installing Niquests and Supported Versions

Niquests is available on PyPI:

```console
$ python -m pip install niquests

## 📝 Why did we pursue this?

For many years now, **Requests** has been frozen. Being left in a vegetative state and not evolving, this blocked millions of developers from using more advanced features.

We don't have to reinvent the wheel all over again, HTTP client **Requests** is well established and
really pleasant in its usage. We believe that **Requests** has the most inclusive and developer friendly interfaces.
We intend to keep it that way. As long as we can, long live Niquests!

How about a nice refresher with a mere `CTRL+H` _import requests_ **to** _import niquests as requests_ ?

## 💼 For Enterprise

Professional support for Niquests is available as part of the [Tidelift
Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-niquests?utm_source=pypi-niquests&utm_medium=readme). Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for
purchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances

---

Niquests is a highly improved HTTP client that is based (forked) on Requests. The previous project original author is Kenneth Reitz and actually left the maintenance of Requests years ago.

[^1]: aiohttp has no support for synchronous request.
[^2]: requests has no support for asynchronous request.
[^3]: while the HTTP/2 connection object can handle concurrent requests, you cannot leverage its true potential.
[^4]: loading client certificate without file can't be done.
[^5]: httpx officially claim to be thread safe but recent tests demonstrate otherwise as of february 2024. https://github.com/jawah/niquests/issues/83#issuecomment-1956065258 https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3072 https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3002
[^6]: they do not expose anything to control network aspects such as IPv4/IPv6 toggles, and timings (e.g. DNS response time, established delay, TLS handshake delay, etc...) and such.
[^7]: while advertised as possible, they refuse to make it the default due to performance issues. as of february 2024 an extra is required to enable it manually.
[^8]: they don't support HTTP/3 at all.
[^9]: you must use a custom DNS resolver so that it can preemptively connect using HTTP/3 over QUIC when remote is compatible.
[^10]: performance measured when leveraging a multiplexed connection with or without uses of any form of concurrency as of May 2024. The research compared `httpx`, `requests`, `aiohttp` against `niquests`. See https://github.com/Ousret/niquests-stats
[^11]: enabled when using a custom DNS resolver.
