## Getting started with your project

First, set up tool chain by using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) tool, add necessary plugins if not installed, run the following commands in project folder,

```bash
asdf plugin add python
asdf plugin add poetry

asdf install
```

Create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands,

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:top-maker/modsim.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks,

```bash
make install
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
