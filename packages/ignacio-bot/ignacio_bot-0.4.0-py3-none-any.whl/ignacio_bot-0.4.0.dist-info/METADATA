# Ignacio Bot

A simple Flask App that uses a fine-tuned OpenAI model to let users chat with a custom bot. 
The bot is trained on interview transcripts from youtube. Additional information can be provided by editing the file system_context.txt.

To run the app, user must set **OPENAI_API_KEY** environment variable, which can be obtained from OpenAI.

The app has been tested on M1 Macbook Air running Python version 3.11.9. 

Install the packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**OPTIONAL**: You can also simply install the 3 needed packages instead of using the requirements file:
``` 
pip install flask openai flask_session 
```

Run the app using:
```
python app.py
```

The chatbot will be availabe through a browser at the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
