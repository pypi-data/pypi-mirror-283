  Application: Where no survey information was recorded or where the information no
    longer exists and there is no other supporting information to justify the use
    of another error model. On a Floating Rig
  Approved: null
  Checked: Steve Grindrod 21-Oct-2020
  Hor East/West Exclusion: 0 deg
  Inclination Range Max: 180 deg
  Inclination Range Min: 0 deg
  Long Name: OWSG BLIND [Floating Rig]
  Misalignment Alt: 3
  Notes: A cone-based uncertainty which would be practically impossible to have drilled
    out of. This model should only be used with a Dispensation.
