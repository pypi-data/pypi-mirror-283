Python wrapper for vis.js Network

> :warning: **Beta version disclaimer** Please note that this package is in a **beta** version and backwards-incompatible changes might be introduced in future releases.


pyvisjs is a Python package designed to provide seamless interaction with [vis.js](https://visjs.org) network visualizations, allowing users to manipulate and visualize network data using Python.

## Usage workflow

1. Create a network using python
2. Apply standard vis.js options such as colors, shapes or physics
3. Apply pyvisjs specific options such as node/edge filtering or highlighting
4. Show or generate html file
5. Enjoy network interactions in your browser

## Installation

You can install PyVisjs via pip:

```bash
pip install pyvisjs
```

## Usage example

```python
from pyvisjs import Network

# Create a Network instance
net = Network()

# Add nodes and edges
net.add_node(1)
net.add_node(2)
net.add_edge(1, 2)

# Display the network
net.show("example.html")
```

For more examples and detailed usage, please refer to the [documentation](https://22kittens.gitlab.io/pyvisjs).
