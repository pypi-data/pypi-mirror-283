‚ö° urllib3.future is a powerful, *user-friendly* HTTP client for Python.<br>
‚ö° urllib3.future goes beyond supported features while remaining compatible.<br>
‚ö° urllib3.future brings many critical features that are missing from both the Python standard libraries **and urllib3**:

- Async.
- Task safety.
- Thread safety.
- Happy Eyeballs.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- Highly customizable DNS resolution.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- DNS over UDP, TLS, QUIC, or HTTPS. DNSSEC protected.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.
- Support for Python/PyPy 3.7+, no compromise.
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- Detailed connection inspection.
- HTTP/2 with prior knowledge.
- Multiplexed connection.
- Mirrored Sync & Async.
- Amazingly Fast.

urllib3.future is powerful and easy to use:

```python
>>> import urllib3
>>> pm = urllib3.PoolManager()
>>> resp = pm.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/robots.txt")
>>> resp.status
200
>>> resp.data
b"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n"
>>> resp.version
20
```

or using asyncio!

```python
import asyncio
import urllib3

async def main() -> None:
    async with urllib3.AsyncPoolManager() as pm:
        resp = await pm.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/robots.txt")
        print(resp.status)  # 200
        body = await resp.data
        print(body)  # # b"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n"
        print(resp.version)  # 20

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Installing

urllib3.future can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):

```bash
$ python -m pip install urllib3.future
```

You either do 

```python
import urllib3
```

Or...

```python
import urllib3_future
```

Or... upgrade any of your containers with...

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

# ... your installation ...
RUN pip install .
# then! (after every other pip call)
RUN pip install urllib3-future
```

Doing `import urllib3_future` is the safest option if you start a project from scratch for you as there is a significant number of projects that
require `urllib3`.

## Notes

- **It's a fork**

‚ö†Ô∏è Installing urllib3.future shadows the actual urllib3 package (_depending on installation order_). 
The semver will always be like _MAJOR.MINOR.9PP_ like 2.0.941, the patch node is always greater or equal to 900.

Support for bugs or improvements is served in this repository. We regularly sync this fork
with the main branch of urllib3/urllib3 against bugfixes and security patches if applicable.

- **OS Package Managers**

Fellow OS package maintainers, you cannot _just_ build and ship this package to your package registry.
As it override `urllib3` and due to its current criticality, you'll have to set:

`URLLIB3_NO_OVERRIDE=true python -m build`. Set `URLLIB3_NO_OVERRIDE` variable with "**true**" in it.

It will prevent the override.

## Compatibility with downstream

You should _always_ install the downstream project prior to this fork.

e.g. I want `requests` to be use this package.

```
python -m pip install requests
python -m pip install urllib3.future
```

Nowadays, we suggest using the package [**Niquests**](https://github.com/jawah/niquests) as a drop-in replacement for **Requests**. 
It leverages urllib3.future capabilities appropriately.
