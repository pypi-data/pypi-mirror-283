""" `trun ...` - run test specified by `...`

The test is run in dedicated environment, which, after test completes, is
checked for leaked files, leaked mount entries, leaked processes, etc.

The environment is activated only if user namespaces are available(*).
If user namespaces are not available, the test is still run but without most of the checks.
