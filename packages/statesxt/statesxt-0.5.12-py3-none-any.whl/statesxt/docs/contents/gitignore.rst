.gitignore
##########

A ``.gitignore`` file is used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes in a repository. This file is particularly useful when you have files or directories in your project that you don't want to include in version control. By defining patterns in the ``.gitignore file``, you can ensure that Git ignores those files and doesn't consider them for commits.

    There are websites out there that provide you to automatically generate .gitignore. For example, you can use this: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore
