``pyproject.toml`` is a configuration file used in Python projects to define project metadata, build settings, and dependencies. It is part of the Python Packaging Authority's specification known as PEP 518, which introduces a standardized way to specify build backend and project configuration.

The ``pyproject.toml`` file is used by tools like Poetry to manage your project's dependencies, build process, and other project-specific settings. It provides a more modern and standardized approach to configuration compared to traditional setup.py files. Additionally, it allows for better integration with various build tools and environments.
