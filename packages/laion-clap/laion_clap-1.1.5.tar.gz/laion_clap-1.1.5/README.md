## About this project

This project is a project in [LAION](https://laion.ai/) that aims at learning better audio understanding and getting more audio data. 
This is an opensource project. We adopt the codebase of [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) for this project. 
The major opensource contributers of this project are (in equal contribution): Yusong Wu, Tianyu Zhang, Ke Chen.

many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfoster0/CLAP">@cfoster0</a> for allowing us to use his repo name.

## Quick Start 
We provide the library for our CLAP model:
```bash
pip install laion_clap
```

Then you can follow the below usage or refer to [unit_test.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/blob/laion_clap_pip/src/laion_clap/unit_test.py).

```python
import librosa
import laion_clap

model = laion_clap.CLAP_Module(enable_fusion=True)
model.load_ckpt()

# Directly get audio embeddings from audio files
audio_file = [
    '/home/la/kechen/Research/KE_CLAP/ckpt/test_clap_short.wav',
    '/home/la/kechen/Research/KE_CLAP/ckpt/test_clap_long.wav'
]
audio_embed = model.get_audio_embedding_from_filelist(x = audio_file)
print(audio_embed)
print(audio_embed.shape)

# Get audio embeddings from audio data
audio_data, _ = librosa.load('/home/la/kechen/Research/KE_CLAP/ckpt/test_clap_short.wav', sr=48000) # sample rate should be 48000
audio_data = audio_data.reshape(1, -1) # Make it (1,T) or (N,T)

audio_embed = model.get_audio_embedding_from_data(x = audio_data)
print(audio_embed)
print(audio_embed.shape)

# Get text embedings from texts:
text_data = ["I love the contrastive learning", "I love the pretrain model"] 
text_embed = model.get_text_embedding(text_data)
print(text_embed)
print(text_embed.shape)
```

## Environment Installation
If you want to check and reuse our model into your project instead of directly using the pip library, you need to install the same environment as we use, please run the following command:
```bash
conda create env -n clap python=3.10
conda activate clap
git clone https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP.git
cd CLAP
# you can also install pytorch by following the official instruction (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset format
We use training data in webdataset format. For details of our dataset please see https://github.com/LAION-AI/audio-dataset.

You can find an example of our dataset format in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aU54FGctrjhxA2sTN0wgHVsPm0nPEc_E?usp=share_link).
It contains the full ESC50 dataset, split according to the first 5-fold split.

## Training, Fine-tuning and Evaluation
Please find the script of training, fine-tuning and evaluation (zero-shot and retrieval) in the [experiment_scripts](./experiment_scripts) folder. 
The scripts included there are the one we used to train our model on a SLURM cluster. 
You need to change the script to fit your own environment.
For example, in a single machine multi-GPU setting, you might want to use `torchrun` instead of `srun` to run the script.
To train on a single GPU machine, use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m ...` instead of `srun`.
We use [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for experiment logging. You need to configure the weights and biases in your environment.

## Core Code
Please refer to [main.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/blob/laion_clap_pip/src/laion_clap/training/main.py), [train.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/blob/laion_clap_pip/src/laion_clap/training/train.py), [data.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/blob/laion_clap_pip/src/laion_clap/training/data.py),and [model.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/blob/laion_clap_pip/src/laion_clap/clap_module/model.py) to quicly get familiar with our model.

## Pretrained Models
The pretrained checkpoints can be found in [here](https://huggingface.co/lukewys/laion_clap/tree/main).
Please refer to the previous section for how to load and run the checkpoints.

The checkpoints list here for each model setting is the one with the highest average mAP score in training.
The average mAP score is calculated by averaging 4 scores: A-->T mAP@10 on AudioCaps, and T-->A mAP@10 on AudioCaps, A-->T mAP@10 on Clotho, and T-->A mAP@10 on Clotho.

## Reproducibility
An example of the preprocessed Clotho dataset in webdataset format can be download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mU9mBOe11jTFCrQRJQsUa4S-3TlNuYoI?usp=sharing) (by downloading, you will be agreeing the license described in the [Clotho dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3490684#.Y9ALPeyZP1w)). The audio encoder pretrained with 48kHz AudioSet can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SMQyzJvc6DwJNuhQ_WI8tlCFL5HG2vk6?usp=sharing), where `HTSAT-fullset-imagenet-map=0.467.ckpt` is the checkpoint used to initalize our HTSAT audio encoder. You should get similar result by loading from the audio encoder checkpoint and training on same dataset.
Because most of the dataset has copyright restriction, unfortunatly we cannot directly share other preprocessed datasets. The caption generated by keyword-to-caption model for Audioset can be found [here](https://github.com/LAION-AI/audio-dataset/tree/main/laion-audio-630k#keyword-to-caption-augmentation)
