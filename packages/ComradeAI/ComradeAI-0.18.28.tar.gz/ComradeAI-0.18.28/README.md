# ComradeAI
Comrade AI is an open source framework to assemble AI services like Claude, Gemini Pro, GPT 3.5/4, Yandex GPT, LLaMa v2 and many more into unified intelligent agents to build a collaborative network.

Comrade AI advances true multimodality and decentralization, using a unified protocol and a digital currency for transactions, alongside supporting independent AI service providers. This streamlined approach not only makes integrating various AI services simpler but also promotes an open, competitive AI marketplace. By commoditizing AI machine time with our digital currency, we make AI resources more accessible, driving innovation and broadening access to cutting-edge technology.
