# River client for Python

An insert-only Python client for [River](https://github.com/riverqueue/river) packaged in the [`riverqueue` package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/riverqueue/). Allows jobs to be inserted in Python and run by a Go worker, but doesn't support working jobs in Python.

## Development
