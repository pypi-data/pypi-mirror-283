# make-resume

This is a Python package that provides a CLI script `make-resume`

It takes resume.yaml in the current directory and produces index.html and
pdf.html

`index.html` is intended to be used on a portfolio website, whereas `pdf.html`
is intended to be converted to PDF using Google Chrome, and the resulting PDF
can be linked to from the portfolio website.

## Installation

    pip install make-resume
