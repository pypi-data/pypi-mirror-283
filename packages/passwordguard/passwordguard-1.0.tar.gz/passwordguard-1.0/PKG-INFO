### passwordguard

passwordguard is a Python library that provides functionalities to assess the strength of passwords based on length, character sets, and common patterns. It also estimates the time required to crack a password using brute-force methods. Use passwordguard to enhance security measures in your applications by ensuring stronger passwords.

passwordguard includes two main functions:
- `passwordguard.calculate_password_strength` evaluates the strength of a given password.
- `passwordguard.calculate_cracking_time` estimates the time required to crack a given password.

#### Example

Here is an example of how to use the passwordguard library in your Python programs:

```python
from passwordguard import calculate_password_strength, calculate_cracking_time

strength = calculate_password_strength(password)
cracking_time = calculate_cracking_time(password)

print(f"Password: {password} - Strength: {strength} - Estimated Cracking Time: {cracking_time}")
