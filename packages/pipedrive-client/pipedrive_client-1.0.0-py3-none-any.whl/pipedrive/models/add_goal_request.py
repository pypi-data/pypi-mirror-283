Type can be one of: `deals_won`, `deals_progressed`, `activities_completed`, `activities_added`, `deals_started` or `revenue_forecast`. `params` can include `pipeline_id`, `stage_id` or `activity_type_id`. `stage_id` is related to only `deals_progressed` type of goals and `activity_type_id` to `activities_completed` or `activities_added` types of goals.
