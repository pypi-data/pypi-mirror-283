# IDF Parser and Geometry 2D/3D Visualiser

Parses an IDF file and provides a JSON-like dictionary of lists. Refer to original README below for information on format.

Also provides functions to generate 2D Projections, 3D Point Clouds, and 3D Mesh visualisations of the
geometry in the IDF file. This is the main feature that sets it apart from the original repo.


# ORIGINAL README
# parseidf.py

Parses an IDF file (as used by EnergyPlus) into a dictionary of lists in the following manner:

- each IDF object is represented by a list of its fields, with the first field being the object type.

- each such list is appended to a list of objects with the same type in the dictionary, indexed by type:

   { A => [[A, x, y, z], [A, a, b, c]],
     B => [[B, 1, 2], [B, 1, 2, 3]] }

- the index keys are all capitalized.

- also, all field values are strings, i.e. no interpretation of the values is made.

# Example

```python
import parseidf

with open(r'in.idf', 'r') as f:
    idf = parseidf.parse(f.read())
print idf.keys()  # lists the object types in the idf file
print idf['OUTPUT:VARIABLE']  # lists all the Output:Variable objects in the idf file
```

# Dependencies

parseidf depends on PLY (Python Lex & Yacc): https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ply/3.4
