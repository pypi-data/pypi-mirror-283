# gg-fpga
FPGA / Python Simulation and Output focused on exchange binary protocol parsing and specifics of byte layout for msg types  
uses SystemVerilog and Python and currently supports interfacing  
with excel and matplotlib.pyplot

### Note:
Currently set up to only work on Linux platforms  

In addition to dependencies in pyproject, also requires:   
  - iverilog  

And, for simulation:  
- verilator (only easily available for Linux systems)
