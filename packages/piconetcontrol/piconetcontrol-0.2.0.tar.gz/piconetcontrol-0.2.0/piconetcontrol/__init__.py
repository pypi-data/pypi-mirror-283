__long_description__ = """This packages provides two classes (`Client` and `Server`)
to manage a Raspberry Pi board (acting as server) via Wifi.

The server is meant to be a Raspberrypi Pico W, but it is meant to also work on e.g.
a Raspberrypi 4. Therefore, the `server_base.py` is compatible with both Python and MicroPython.
Some functionalities might not be available for both interpreters, though."""
