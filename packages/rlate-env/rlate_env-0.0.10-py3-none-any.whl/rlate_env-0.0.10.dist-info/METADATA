# RL Enviros

RL Enviros is a collection of custom environments compatible with Gymnasium, designed to simulate various games and scenarios for reinforcement learning experiments. This project aims to provide a variety of environments to help researchers and enthusiasts develop and test reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Installation

### PyPi

You can install the `rlate-env` package directly from PyPi:

```bash
pip install rlate-env
```

## Environments

### PickHigh

PickHigh is a simple game where the player picks between two cards, aiming to select the higher card. This environment is useful for testing basic reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Observation Space**: Discrete space of size 100, representing two cards (e.g., 34 for left card 3 and right card 4).
- **Action Space**: Discrete space of size 2. Action 0 selects the left card, and action 1 selects the right card.
- **Reward**:
    - +1 if the chosen card is higher.
    - 0 if both cards are the same.
    - -1 if the chosen card is lower.
- **Episode Termination**: The episode terminates when the player picks a card that is different from the dealer's card.

[Detailed Documentation for PickHigh](src/gymnasium_rlate/pick_high/README.md)

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `PickHigh` environment:

```python
import gymnasium_rlate as rlate

# Create the Canon environment
env = rlate.Cannon()

# Reset the environment
obs, info = env.reset()
print(obs)

# Make a step in the environment
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(23.5)
print(obs, reward, terminated)


# Render the environment
print(env.render())

# Close the environment
env.close()
```
