Scanbot is a collection of several automated STM and nc-AFM data acquisition commands compatible with Nanonis V5 and V5e SPM control software (stable with R12280 and later).

<strong>Full documentation available [here](https://new-horizons-spm.github.io/scanbot/web-app/).</strong>

## Functional Overview
* STM
    - Bias dependent imaging with drift correction
    - Automated sample surveying (NxN grid)
* STS
    - STS Grids with drift correction
* nc-AFM (coming soon in the web app version)
    - z-dependent nc-AFM
    - nc-AFM registration
* Automation
    - Tip shaping
    - Full control over the course motors
* Hooks
    - Scanbot has a number of built-in [hooks](https://new-horizons-spm.github.io/scanbot/hooks/) to let you customise key functionality.
