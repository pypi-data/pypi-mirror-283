GUI for the GARMI robot's face screen with remote control to show images, play
videos and sounds, and render text.

## Install

To install run

```
pip install garmi-gui
```

or if you're working with the code in a local clone of the repository

```
pip install -v -e .[dev]
```

Checkout the [contribution guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Run

The Python package installs executables for convenience. You can start the GUI
by simply running `garmi-gui`. This will start the GUI in fullscreen mode. For
development purposes it is convenient to run the GUI in windowed mode, you can
do so by executing `garmi-gui --windowed`.

## Remote Control

The GUI is controlled remotely using xmlrpc. There is a convenience terminal
script to quickly execute GUI functions. You can run the tool by executing
`garmi-gui-control --hostname <gui-hostname>` where <gui-hostname> is the
hostname of the computer running the GUI.

To control the GUI from Python simply connect with an xmlrpc client and call the
remote functions like this:

```
from xmlrpc import client

hostname = "localhost"
port = 8000

server_url = f"http://{hostname}:{port}"
proxy = client.ServerProxy(server_url)

proxy.show_image("happy.png")
proxy.play_sound("success.wav")
```

You may specify an absolute path to a file on the computer running the GUI,
relative paths are evaluated relative to the
[resources](https://github.com/JeanElsner/garmi-gui/tree/main/src/garmi_gui/resources)
directory. Checkout the documentation or the control script for a complete list
of possible commands.
