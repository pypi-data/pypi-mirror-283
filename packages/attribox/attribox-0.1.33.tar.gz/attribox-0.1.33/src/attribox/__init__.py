"""The 'attribox' package provides an interface between custom classes
owning attributes belonging to other classes. Normally, to achieve this
the class providing an attribute for the owning class are required to
implement accessor methods. This package provides a convenient wrapper
that can be applied to existing classes allowing them to become attributes
other classes without requiring implementation of accessor methods. """
