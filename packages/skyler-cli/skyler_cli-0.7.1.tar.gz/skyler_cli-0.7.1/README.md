# Skyler's CLI
[![Test](https://github.com/bouldersky/skylers-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bouldersky/skylers-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is a modular CLI tool box that I tailor to my needs over time. It includes:

- A command to bootstrap all my . files onto a new workstation
- Pretty printing DICOM files
