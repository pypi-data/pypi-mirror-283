    FilterRequest defines the filtering to be applied to the entities returned
    by a bulk read request.

    Attributes:
        filter (str): Field names must appear on the left-hand side of a
            comparison operator; the right-hand side accepts only literals and
            logical operators.  A filter can only reference fields which are
            listed in the table definition in the relevant persistence
            repository.  When a filter compares the value of an enumeration,
            it can specify the value either as an integer or as a string
            containing the corresponding enumeration string, as in `severity =
            "major"` above.
