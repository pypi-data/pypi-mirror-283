## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The SkyscannerReferrals API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```py
SkyscannerReferrals(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER"
)
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER")
```
