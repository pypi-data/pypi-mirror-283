<!-- # Neural Latent Geometry Manifolds -->

> [!CAUTION]
> The package is still in its early stages. Updates may cause breaking changes.

Neural Latent Geometry Manifolds (`nlgm`) is a Python package inspired by the approach taken in [Neural Latent Geometry Search: Product Manifold Inference via Gromov-Hausdorff-Informed Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04810.pdf).

The main high-level features include:
- Implementation of the neural latent geometry search framework, a novel approach to infer product manifolds by leveraging Gromov-Hausdorff distances.
- Various optimization methods to suit different requirements.

This package is compatible with libraries like NumPy and PyTorch. For documentation, see [docs](https://ae-bii.github.io/nlgm/).

To install `nlgm`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install nlgm
```

## Usage

After installing, you can import the package and use it by following the [example](https://github.com/ae-bii/nlgm/blob/main/examples/example.py).
