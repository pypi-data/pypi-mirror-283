# Getting Started üåü

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **BEFORE INSTALLATION** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Before installing gvision, it's strongly recommended to create a new Python environment to avoid potential conflicts with your current environment.**


## Creating a New Conda Environment

To create a new conda environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**:
   If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install it from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Open a Anaconda Prompt**:
   Open a Anaconda Prompt (or Anaconda Terminal) on your system.

3. **Create a New Environment**:
   To create a new conda environment, use the following command. Replace `my_env_name` with your desired environment name.
- Support Python versions¬†are¬†>¬†3.8
```bash
conda create --name my_env_name python=3.8
```

4. **Activate the Environment**:
    After creating the environment, activate it with the following command:
```bash
conda activate my_env_name
```

## OR
## Create a New Virtual Environment with `venv`
If you prefer using Python's built-in `venv` module, here's how to create a virtual environment:

1. **Check Your Python Installation**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:
   - Support Python versions¬†are¬†>¬†3.8
```bash
python --version
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
Use the following command to create a new virtual environment. Replace `my_env_name` with your desired environment name.
```bash
python -m venv my_env_name
```

3. **Activate the Environment**:
After creating the virtual environment, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system:
```bash
my_env_name\Scripts\activate
```


# Installation üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Installation**
You can install GVISION using pip:
```bash
pip install gvision
```
# Global CLI
2. **Run GVISION**: Launch the GVISION application directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI).
```bash
gvision
```

3. Import Your Data: Use the Roboflow integration to import datasets and preprocess your data.

4. Train Your Model: Utilize Ultralytics for training your custom models with ease.

5. Deploy Your Model: Showcase your trained models with Streamlit deployment for interactive visualization.
