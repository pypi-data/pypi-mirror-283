The library contains standard CART based methologies for growing trees, includind twoing, as well as non standard techniques two-stage techniques like fast and latent-budget tree. There is also cross validation methods for pruning the tree, and k-folds implementation. As well as a graphical interface to view the tree and information about the nodes, including visual pruning by viewing thhe decrease in deviance created by a split relative to other splits in the grown tree, and an output table containing useful information.
