This module defines the interface for configuring message acknowledgement strategy. In some scenarios,
when a specific message is published, the receiver that has received that message can send an
acknowledgement for the message that was received back to the publisher. With auto-acknowledgement,
you can automatically acknowledge each message. With client-acknowledgement, the user-defined
application must deliberately acknowledge messages.

    An abstract class that defines the interface to configure message acknowledgement strategy.

    The default strategy enables client-acknowledgement and disables auto-acknowledgement.

        Enables support for message client-acknowledgement (client-ack) on all receiver methods,
        which includes both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Client-acknowledgement must be
        executed by the user-defined application. It is recommended that client-acknowledgement
        be written in the on_message method of the user defined message handler. This message handler would be
        of type :py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageHandler`.
