# Urlify

## A JupyterLab Extension for Sharing Notebooks via URL

Urlify is a JupyterLab extension that allows you to easily share your Jupyter notebooks by encoding their content into a URL. This enables quick sharing and collaboration without the need for file transfers or cloud storage.

## Features

- **Save to URL**: Compress and encode your notebook content into a shareable URL with a single click.
- **Configurable Settings**: Choose whether to include cell outputs and select the appropriate URL path for your Jupyter environment.
- **Large Notebook Handling**: Special handling for notebooks exceeding 10,000 characters, with options to include full content or inputs only.
- **Easy Sharing**: The generated URL is automatically copied to your clipboard for immediate sharing.

## Installation

To install the extension, run the following command in your environment:

```
pip install urlify
```

## Usage

1. Open a Jupyter notebook in JupyterLab.
2. Look for the "Save to URL" button in the notebook toolbar.
3. Click the main button to save the current state of your notebook to a URL.
4. Use the settings icon (gear) next to the main button to configure options:
   - Toggle including cell outputs
   - Select the appropriate URL path for your Jupyter environment
5. Share the generated URL with your colleagues or students.

## Configuration

The extension provides two main configuration options:

1. **Copy Notebook Output**: When enabled, cell outputs are included in the generated URL. This is disabled by default to keep URLs shorter but will require the recipient to run the notebook to see the outputs.
2. **URL Path**: Choose the appropriate path based on your Jupyter environment:
   - `/lab/index.html` for JupyterLab
   - `/retro/notebooks/index.html` for Jupyter Notebook

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the Vega Editor's "Save to URL" feature and PyCafe's goal to simplify sharing python data apps. We've adapted these ideas to the Jupyter ecosystem, aiming to make notebook sharing as easy as passing along a URL. While our approach differs, we're all working towards making collaboration in the coding world more accessible. We encourage you to check out these awesome projects too: Vega Editor (https://vega.github.io/editor/) and PyCafe (https://py.cafe/).
