Key Benefits
-----------
* **Customizable Search Experience**: Users can specify which fields to search on the fly, making it easier to perform targeted queries.
* **Enhanced Usability**: Provides an intuitive interface to select search fields, improving efficiency in data management.
* **Performance Optimization**: Reduces the overhead of searching across unnecessary fields, enhancing query performance.


How To Use
-----------

1. Install package with `pip install django-admin-search-fields`.


2. Add `django_admin_search_fields` to  `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`. `django_admin_search_fields` should placed before the used apps:
```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "django_admin_search_fields",
        ...
        "your_app"
    ]
```

3. Import and inherit `DjangoAdminSearchFieldModelAdmin` to your custom model admin class and set `search_field_choices` like below:

``` 
    from django_admin_search_fields.admin import DjangoAdminSearchFieldModelAdmin
    
    class PostAdmin(DjangoAdminSearchFieldModelAdmin):
        search_field_choices = (
            ('title', True, 'Title'),  # Prechecked by default
            ('subtitle', False),       # Not prechecked by default
            ('author__first_name', False, _("Author's first name"))  # Requires a verbose name for relational fields
        )
        ...
    
    admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)

```
