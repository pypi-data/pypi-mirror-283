What is this?
-------------

**LightDB** is a simple and lightweight JSON database for Python that allows users to **efficiently** write data to a file. It is designed to be **easy to use**, making it a great choice for developers who need a fast and reliable way to store and retrieve data


Features
--------

- **Lightweight and Simple**: LightDB is a lightweight database implemented as a Python dictionary with an intuitive API for easy key-value management
- **JSON Storage and Persistence**: Data is stored and retained in a JSON file, allowing easy external editing and persistence between runs
- **Reset Capability**: Provides a reset method to clear the database and start fresh
- **Type Agnostic**: Can store any Python object as a value
- **Portable**: Easily transferable between systems, ideal for simple data storage
- **Model Support**: Supports models for structured data management, ensuring organized and maintainable code


Installing
----------

You can install LightDB using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install LightDB


Usage
-----

To use LightDB, first import the ``LightDB`` class from the ``lightdb`` package:

.. code-block:: python

    from lightdb import LightDB

Then, create a ``LightDB`` object by passing in the path to a JSON file where the database will be stored:

.. code-block:: python

    db = LightDB("db.json")

You can then set key-value pairs in the database using the ``set()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    db.set("name", "Alice")
    db.set("age", 30)

To save the changes, use the ``save()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    db.save()


Using Models
------------

LightDB supports defining models for more structured and convenient data management. Hereâ€™s how to use models with LightDB:

First, import the necessary classes:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import List, Dict, Any

    from lightdb import LightDB
    from lightdb.models import Model

Define your model by extending the ``Model`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    class User(Model, table="users"):
        name: str
        age: int
        items: List[str] = []
        extra: Dict[str, Any] = {}

Create a new instance of the model and save it to the database:

.. code-block:: python

    user = User.create(name="Alice", age=30)

Retrieve a user from the database:

.. code-block:: python

    user = User.get(User.name == "Alice")
    # or user = User.get(name="Alice")
    print(user.name, user.age)

Update a userâ€™s information and save it:

.. code-block:: python

    user.name = "Kristy"
    user.save()

Filter users based on certain criteria:

.. code-block:: python

    users = User.filter(User.age >= 20)
    for user in users:
        print(user.name)

Delete a user:

.. code-block:: python

    user.delete()
