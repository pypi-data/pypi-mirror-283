"""Highest level RabbitMQ wrapper.

Contains high-level wrappers for RabbitMQ, implementing many common
use cases with built-in threading. The RmqConnection object is meant to
be used on a clustered RabbitMQ server with quorum queues. For details
on clustering and quorum queues, please see the RabbitMQ documentation
of both (https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html and
https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html). For a good visualization of
the underlying Raft algorithm that quorum queues use, see
http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/. Most of the functional methods
contained in RmqConnection are meant to be used as method decorators, though
the private methods they employ can be used in a standalone manner. See
the examples section below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    username : str, optional
        The username to use when logging into the RabbitMQ server, defaults to
        'guest'. Sometimes 'guest' login is not allowed, so it is recommended
        to set up a different user for connecting. The username here must
        correspond to a user with admin privileges.
    password : str, optional
        The password to use when logging into RabbitMQ, defaults to 'guest'.
    host : str, optional
        The hostname of the RabbitMQ server, defaults to 'localhost'. Using
        localhost to host RabbitMQ is fine for some applications, but it is
        not recommended. If using a clustered RabbitMQ server, any of the
        cluster hostnames works (e.g. 'rabbit-1' or 'rabbit-2'). This can also
        use an IP address intead of a hostname, but hostnames are recommended.
    port : int, optional
        The port of the RabbitMQ server, defaults to 5672. Most RabbitMQ
        servers use port 5672, but some applications may have a different port.
        For example, a virtual cluster hosted on one machine may use ports
        5672, 5673, and 5674.
    autoconnect : bool, optional
        Automatically run the ``connect`` method to sync to the Connection
        object, defaults to True. It is recommended to leave autoconnect
        enabled, but some use cases may require connecting at a specific time.
        If this is required, run the ``connect`` method to perform the connection
        tasks.

    Attributes
    ----------
    username : str
        The username used to authenticate with the RabbitMQ server.
    password : str
        The password used for RabbitMQ authentication.
    host : str
        The host (ip or hostname) of the RabbitMQ server (or one of the
        clustered servers).
    port : int
        The port the RabbitMQ server is using (usually 5672).
    autoconnect : bool
        Automatically run the ``connect`` method on initialization if True.
    threads : List[threading.Thread]
        A list of the threads contained within the RmqConnection instance.
        These threads are started with the ``run`` method and stoped with the
        ``stop`` method.
    stop_event : threading.Event
        The threading Event used to shutdown all the threads running RabbitMQ
        processes.
    exchanges : Dict[str, Tuple[str, pika.ExchangeType]]
        A dictionary containing information about all the exchanges involved
        in this RMQ process. The key is the purpose of the exchange (e.g.
        'logs'), and the value is a tuple of the exchange name and the
        exchange type.
    publishers : Dict[str, Publisher]
        A dictionary containing information about all the publishers involved
        in this RMQ process. The key is the name of the publisher (e.g.
        'status') and the value is a Publisher object. These are usually auto-
        generated within the method decorators and are named with the routing
        key they correspond to (e.g. 'device.1.status').
    publish_props : Dict[str, pika.BasicProperties]
        A dictionary containing information about all the publish properties
        involved in this RMQ process. The key is the name of the Publisher (so
        as to map it directly with the ``publishers`` attribute) and the value
        is a pika.BasicProperties object. This is used to pass properties into
        the Publisher's connection to the server and is usually auto-generated.
    subscribers : Dict[str, Subscriber]
        A dictionary containing information about all the subscribers involved
        in this RMQ process. The key is the name of the subscriber (e.g.
        'device_logs') and the value is a Subscriber object. These are usually
        auto-generated within the method decorators used for subscribing.
    response_handlers : Dict[str, (Any) -> Any]
        A dictionary containing information about all the response handlers
        involved in this RMQ process. The key is an identifier and the value
        is a callback function to serve as the response handler for a specific
        process. These response handlers are used in the RPC processes to
        determine which function needs to be called to handle the RPC response.
        The identifier is usually related to a command system (e.g.
        'device_command').
