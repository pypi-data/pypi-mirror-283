    Parameters
    ----------
    ptype : 'topic' | 'fanout' | 'direct'
        The type of publisher. Topic publishers send messages to specific
        routing keys. Fanout publishers send messages to all queues on an
        exchange. Direct publishers are used for RPC calls, and they publish
        to a single queue. The exchange type corresponds to the publisher
        type (i.e. direct exchange for direct publisher).
    exchange : str, optional
        The name of the exchange to use for publishing. Leaving this value
        blank uses the default exchange and is not supported for some types
        of interactions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ptype : 'fanout' | 'topic' | 'direct'
        The type of publisher this is.
    etype : pika.ExchangeType
        The type of exchange used by this publisher. Corresponds to ptype.
    exchange_name : str
        The name of the exchange this publisher operates on.
    Connection : rmqtools.Connection
        The Connection object associated with this publisher.
    channel : pika.BlockingChannel
        The channel used by this publisher to connect to RabbitMQ.
    exchange : rmqtools.connection.Exchange
        The Exchange object associated with etype and exchange_name. Allows
        for syncing the publisher with the Connection object.
