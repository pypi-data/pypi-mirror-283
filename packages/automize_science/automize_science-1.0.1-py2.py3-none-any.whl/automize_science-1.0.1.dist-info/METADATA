# Automize Science

## What is it

Automize Science is a Python package designed to elaborate data into graphs coming from lipid extractions (LC/MS).
Starting from a file containing the **pmol/mg** values per each sample, this package streamlines the process of data
analysis and visualization.

## Features

Automize Science includes the following features:

- Data Sanitization: Clean and prepare data for analysis, removing internal standard samples and non value samples.
- Data Normalization: Normalize values with log10 to ensure consistency across samples.
- Normality Check: Use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normality of residuals.
- Equality of Variance Check: Use Levene's test to assess the equality of variances.
- Statistical Significance Annotation: Annotate boxplots with significance levels using t-test, Welch's t-test, or
  Mann-Whitney test depending on the data requirements, through the starbars package.
- Visualization Tools: Create boxplots to aid in data interpretation.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```
pip install automize-science
```

\
Alternatively, you can install the package from the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/elide-b/automize-science.git
cd automize-science
pip install .
```

## Usage

Here is one example of how to use Automize Science:

```
import automize_science 

# Example usage
df = automize_science.data_workflow(
    file_path="My project.xlsx",
    data_sheet="Data Sheet",
    mice_sheet="Mice Sheet",
    output_path="C:/Users/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Documents/example",
    control_name="CM",
)

automize_science.zscore_graph_region(
    df_final=df,
    control_name="CM",
    experimental_name="EM",
    output_path="C:/Users/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Documents/example",
    palette="Set2",
    show=True,
)
```

Returns graphs.
