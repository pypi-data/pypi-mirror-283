# Releases

## perceval-zulip 0.2.1 - (2022-07-13)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Support package namespaces with Poetry\
   This package was not working with poetry install. Convert this package
   in a native namespace package as defined by PEP 420.

**Others:**

 * Bump dependencies\
   Bump dependencies of the package to use the latest versions.


## perceval-zulip 0.2.0 - (2022-01-06)

**Security fixes:**

 * Drop Python < 3.7 support\
   Python versions previous to 3.7 ended their security support life in
   December 2021. This new release drops its support too.


## perceval-zulip 0.1.1 - (2021-09-22)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Change `email` to zulip argument group (#1)\
   The current implementation uses `token_auth` and supports  `email` as
   an argument. But, `email` is not an optional argument. The auth fails
   if no `email` is provided. To handle this, the email is moved to a new
   zulip argument group. Now, it throws an error is `email` is missing.


## perceval-zulip 0.1.0 - (2021-08-03)

**New features:**

 * Add Zulip Backend\
   The support for fetching messages from a Zulip stream using perceval
   is added. The user can create a bot for  the email and api_token,
   required for authentication. The backend can be used as: ``` $
   perceval zulip '<URL>' '<STREAM>' -e '<EMAIL>' -t '<API_KEY>' ```
