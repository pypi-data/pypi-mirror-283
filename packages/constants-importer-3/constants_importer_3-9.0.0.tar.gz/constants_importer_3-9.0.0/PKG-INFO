# constants-importer

A package for initialising the path to the Constants.py file in a root repo, and then importing said constants into the current directory.

## Usage

1. Import the module in your file
```
from constants_importer.import_constants import get_constants
```

2. Within the file you would like to pull your constants into, get the system path.
```
system_path = sys.path[0]
```

3. Use the `get_constants` method to import your constants, pass through the system path and the name of the root repository where the Constants.py file lives.

```
constants = get_constants(system_path, "platform-enablement")
```

4. Reference the specific constants you need as such:
```
PROD_URL = constants.PROD_URL
```
