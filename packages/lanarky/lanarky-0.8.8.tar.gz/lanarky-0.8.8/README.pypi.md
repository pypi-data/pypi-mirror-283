> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is now in maintenance mode. I won't be adding new features or actively maintaining the project as I have moved on to other projects and priorities. While I will address critical bugs and security issues as needed, active development has ceased from my end. I do encourage the community to continue to contribute to the project if they find it useful. Thank you for using lanarky!

Lanarky is a **python (3.9+)** web framework for developers who want to build microservices using LLMs.
Here are some of its key features:

- **LLM-first**: Unlike other web frameworks, lanarky is built specifically for LLM developers.
  It's unopinionated in terms of how you build your microservices and guarantees zero vendor lock-in
  with any LLM tooling frameworks or cloud providers
- **Fast & Modern**: Built on top of FastAPI, lanarky offers all the FastAPI features you know and love.
  If you are new to FastAPI, visit [fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) to learn more
- **Streaming**: Streaming is essential for many real-time LLM applications, like chatbots. Lanarky has
  got you covered with built-in streaming support over **HTTP** and **WebSockets**.
- **Open-source**: Lanarky is open-source and free to use. Forever.

To learn more about lanarky and get started, you can find the full documentation on [lanarky.ajndkr.com](https://lanarky.ajndkr.com)

## Installation

The library is available on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install lanarky
```

## Getting Started

Lanarky provides a powerful abstraction layer to allow developers to build
simple LLM microservices in just a few lines of code.

Here's an example to build a simple microservice that uses OpenAI's `ChatCompletion` service:

```python
from lanarky import Lanarky
from lanarky.adapters.openai.resources import ChatCompletionResource
from lanarky.adapters.openai.routing import OpenAIAPIRouter

app = Lanarky()
router = OpenAIAPIRouter()


@router.post("/chat")
def chat(stream: bool = True) -> ChatCompletionResource:
    system = "You are a sassy assistant"
    return ChatCompletionResource(stream=stream, system=system)


app.include_router(router)
```

and testing your first LLM microservice with Lanarky.
