An AI vulnerability detection tool has analyzed a project and come up with a possible lead, included below.

Your task is to score this lead based uniquely on whether it corresponds to one of the actual vulnerabilities displayed below.

The score should be 1 if the lead corresponds to one of the actual vulnerabilities, and 0 if it doesn't correspond to any of them, or if it kind of corresponds to one, but is significantly off or imprecise (for instance if it's overly broad, or doesn't mention a realistic attack vector).

If and only if the score is 1, the corresponding real vulnerability ID must be returned. It is extracted from the "id" field of the vulnerability.

Your reply must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type ScoreResponse, according to the following Pydantic definition:

```python
class ScoreResponse(BaseModel):
    reasoning: str = Field(description="Your reasoning behind the score.")
    score: Literal[0, 1] = Field(description="The score for the vulnerability submission. Must be 0 or 1.")
    corresponds_to: str | None = Field(description="The ID of the vulnerability that the submission corresponds to, if and only if the score is 1. Do not include if score is 0.", default=None)
```

Here are some examples to help calibrate your response:

<example_1>
<vulnerability_submission>
headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability
analysis: The application uses the pickle module to serialize and deserialize configuration data. Pickle is known to be insecure for deserializing untrusted data, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious pickle payload and trick the application into deserializing it, leading to remote code execution.
cwe: CWE-502
function_names: ['load_config']
filenames: ['app/routes.py']

{{
  "id": "CVE-2024-22204",
  "details": "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. Versions 0.8.3 and prior have a limited file write vulnerability when the configuration options in Whoogle are enabled. The `config` function in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `name` variable on line 447 and `config_data` variable on line 437. The `name` variable is insecurely concatenated in `os.path.join`, leading to path manipulation. The POST data from the `config_data` variable is saved with `pickle.dump` which leads to a limited file write. However, the data that is saved is earlier transformed into a dictionary and the `url` key value pair is added before the file is saved on the system. All in all, the issue allows us to save and overwrite files on the system that the application has permissions to, with a dictionary containing arbitrary data and the `url` key value, which is a limited file write. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for this issue."
}}
{{
  "id": "CVE-2024-22203",
  "details": "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions prior to 0.8.4, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a GET request on lines 339-343 in `request.py`, which leads to a server-side request forgery. This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on behalf of the server. For example, this issue would allow for accessing resources on the internal network that the server has access to, even though these resources may not be accessible on the internet. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.4."

Response:
```yaml
reasoning: |
  While CVE-2024-22204 also mentions the pickle module, the vulnerability is about a limited file write vulnerability, while the submission is an overly broad statement on using `pickle.load()` without any details on a specific threat model where the pickled data could be attacker-controlled. The submission is too broad and doesn't correspond to any of the vulnerabilities.

headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in output
analysis: The sanitizeHtml function appears to lack proper sanitization and encoding for certain types of special characters and entities in the output HTML, which could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

The escapeHtml function only encodes a limited set of characters (&, <, >, and "), but other special characters and entities may not be properly encoded or neutralized, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts in the output HTML.

headline: Insufficient Input Validation
analysis: The codebase has multiple instances of improper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection (e.g. SQL injection, command injection, etc.). These vulnerabilities are present in the following functions:
- bootbox.dialog: The options parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code through button labels, button IDs, and other options.
- bootbox.alert, bootbox.confirm, bootbox.prompt: The arguments passed to these functions are not properly validated, which can lead to similar injection vulnerabilities.

  The closest match is CVE-2017-1000188, which also mentions XSS. The submission mentions the function `exports.render` in file `lib/ejs.js`. This seems close enough to the CVE's mention of `ejs.renderFile()`. I'll score this as a match.

Response:
```yaml
reasoning: |
  Both CVEs are very similar, but the closest match is CVE-2024-21663 as it mentions "shell commands". That being said, the submission is rather low-effort, as it only amounts to saying that shell=True is insecure, without mentioning a specific situation where an attacker can control the input to these subprocess calls. In addition, we're not even sure that the CVE is about any of these commands with shell=True. So I'll give this a score of 0.
