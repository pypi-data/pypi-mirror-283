"""This module defines a Sharepoint class that facilitates interactions with a SharePoint site.
It provides methods for authenticating with the site, listing files in a specified document
library folder, downloading files, and saving them to a local directory. The class is designed
to encapsulate all necessary functionalities for handling files on a SharePoint site, making it
suitable for scripts or applications that require automated access to SharePoint resources.

The Sharepoint class uses the Office365-REST-Python-Client library to communicate with SharePoint,
handling common tasks such as authentication, file retrieval, and file management. This includes
methods to authenticate users, fetch file lists from specific library folders, download individual
files, and save them locally. The class is initialized with user credentials and site details, which
are used throughout the class to manage SharePoint interactions.

Usage:
    After creating an instance of the Sharepoint class with the necessary credentials and site details,
    users can call methods to list files in a folder, download a specific file, or retrieve and save
    all files from a folder to a local directory. This makes it easy to integrate SharePoint file
    management into automated workflows or systems.

Example:
    sharepoint_details = {
        "username": "john@do.e",
        "password": "johndoe",
        "site_url": "https://site_url",
        "site_name": "department123",
        "document_library": "Shared documents"
    }
    sp = Sharepoint(**sharepoint_details)
    sp.get_files(sp, "FolderName", "C:\\LocalPath")

This module requires the `office365.sharepoint.client_context`, `office365.runtime.auth.user_credential`,
and `office365.sharepoint.files.file` modules from Office365-REST-Python-Client.
