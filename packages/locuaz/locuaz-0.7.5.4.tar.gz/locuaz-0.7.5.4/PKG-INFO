Create a conda environment YAML file named, for example, ``usr_deps.yaml``::

    name: locuaz

    dependencies:
      - conda-forge::python>=3.10
      - conda-forge::ambertools>=22.0.0
      - conda-forge::tensorflow
      - conda-forge::openbabel
      - conda-forge::pygraphviz

by running:

.. code-block:: console

    mamba env create -f usr_deps.yaml

Then, activate the environment and install the protocol through pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install locuaz

Check the `Installation`_ section on the docs for more info.


Post-Install
-------------

Using DLPacker based mutators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to used *DLPacker* based *Mutators* (``dlp`` and ``dlpr``), DLPacker weights have to be downloaded.
Get them `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J4fV9aAr2nssrWN8mQ7Ui-9PVQseE0LQ/view?usp=sharing>`_
or `here`_. These weights have to be extracted to a dedicated folder and its path has to be specified in the
input config under the ``paths`` key, on the  ``mutator`` option. Check the `docs`_ for more info.


Running
-------

After that, running *locauz* is as simple as:


.. code-block:: console

    # Activate your environment
    mamba activate locuaz
    # Point locuaz to your config file
    locuaz config.yaml

Check the `tutorials`_ for info on how to write this config file.
