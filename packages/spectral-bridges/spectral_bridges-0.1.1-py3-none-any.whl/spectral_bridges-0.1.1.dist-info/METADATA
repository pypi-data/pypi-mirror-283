# Spectral Bridges

Spectral Bridges is a novel and scalable clustering algorithm that draws inspiration from SVM's margin concept, using k-means clustering and spectral clustering based on Laplacian matrices by first creating a Voronoi tesselation and subsequently merging cells according to a connectivity measure. This package provides efficient clustering solutions for large datasets.

## Features

- **Spectral Bridges**: Combines k-means and spectral clustering with efficient affinity matrix calculation to provide robust clustering results.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install spectral-bridges
