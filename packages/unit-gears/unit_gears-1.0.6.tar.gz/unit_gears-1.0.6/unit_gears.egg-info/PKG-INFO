# unit_gears
Unit Fishing Gears intensity model and library for industrial ecology research.

## Unit Gear Model

![Unit Gear Model](docs/images/Fig1-unit-gear-model.png)

Schematic diagram of the unit gear model as three distinct stages that each transform an input variable to an output variable. The dimensions of each variable are reported in square brackets.

## Included Data Sources

Library models are included in the `models` directory of the repository.  Each `json` file is read for the following fields:

 * `source_` Every field starting with this string is added to a source documentation string
 * `effort_models` list of effort intensity models
 * `gear_models` list of gear intensity models
 * `dissipation_models` list of dissipation models
