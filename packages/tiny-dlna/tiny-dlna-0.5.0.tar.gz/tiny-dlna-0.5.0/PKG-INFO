A tiny DLNA receiver.

Install
-------

::

    $ pip install tiny-dlna

Usages

    $ tiny-render

This will activate a DLNA receiver named "Tiny Render", which can stream videos
from apps like 虎牙直播, Bilibili, and other video platforms. Additionally, you
can also use `nano-dlna` to play local videos (like in your RaspberryPi) on it.

Note: mpv needs to be installed on your system.
