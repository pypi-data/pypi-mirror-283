A Flask middleware extension for automatic input sanitization, guarding against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, and other code injection attacks.


## Key Features

- **Effortless Integration:**  Activate the middleware with a single line of code.
- **Automatic Protection:** Sanitizes incoming request data without requiring manual intervention in your route handlers.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Scrubs query parameters, form data, and JSON payloads.
- **Targeted Defense:** Neutralizes malicious code through HTML entity encoding and regex-based filtering.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt the sanitization logic to your specific application's needs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flask-sanitize-escape
```

## Usage

#### 1. Activate Middleware:
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sanitize_escape import SanitizeEscapeExtension

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = SanitizeEscapeExtension.Middleware(app.wsgi_app)
```
#### 2. Relax! Your application's input data is now automatically sanitized before it reaches your route handlers.
