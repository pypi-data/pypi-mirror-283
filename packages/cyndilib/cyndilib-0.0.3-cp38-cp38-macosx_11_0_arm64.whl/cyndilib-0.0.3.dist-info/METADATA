A Python wrapper for `NDI®`_ written in `Cython`_


Description
***********

NDI® allows video and audio to be reliably sent and received over IP with
minimal latency and very high quality. For more information see https://ndi.video.

This project aims to wrap most functionality of the `NDI® SDK`_ for use in
Python. Due to the real-time nature of audio and video, nearly all of this
library is written in `Cython`_ for performance purposes. By design, "cyndilib"
may be used within other Cython code.

  * - PyPI
    - https://pypi.org/project/cyndilib


Installation
************

Installation via ``pip`` is supported using pre-built platform wheels::

    pip install cyndilib

All of the necessary headers and Cython files are included in the distribution.
This will allow for development of applications directly using
``cimport`` directives.


Building
========

For Windows, the `NDI® SDK`_ will need to be downloaded and installed before
building. MacOS and most Linux shouldn't require this.

Clone or download the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/nocarryr/cyndilib.git
    cd cyndilib


If `pipenv <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ is installed on your system,
the provided Pipfile may be used::

    pipenv install --dev


If encountering errors, try compiling the extensions manually using::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace


This should display more useful error messages.


Usage
*****

Documentation can be found at https://cyndilib.readthedocs.io.
Since this project is still in its early stages of development however,
a look at the example code and tests in the repository might be more useful.
