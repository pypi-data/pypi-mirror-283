  🚀 Supercharge your Python regex with Rust-powered performance!
</div>

## 🌟 Why flpc?

flpc is a powerful Python library that wraps the blazing-fast [Rust regex crate](https://crates.io/crates/regex), bringing enhanced speed to your regular expression operations. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for Python's native `re` module, with some minor syntax differences.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install flpc:
   ```
   pip install flpc
   ```

2. Use it in your code as shown in the API

## 🔧 API

flpc mirrors the `re` module's API, with a few small exceptions:

- Use `fmatch()` instead of `match()` (to avoid conflicts with Python's keyword)
- When using `group()` on a match object, always provide an index (e.g., `group(0)` for the entire match)

Common functions include:

- `compile()`
- `search()`
- `findall()`
- `finditer()`
- `split()`
- `sub()`
- `subn()`

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Pre-compile your patterns for faster execution
- Use raw strings (`r''`) for cleaner regex patterns
- Always check if a match is found before accessing groups
- Remember to use `group(0)` to get the entire match
