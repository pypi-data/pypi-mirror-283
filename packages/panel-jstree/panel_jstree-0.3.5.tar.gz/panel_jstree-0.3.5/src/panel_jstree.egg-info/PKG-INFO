# ‚ú® panel-jstree

panel-jstree is a wrapper python wrapper around the javascript library [jstree](https://www.jstree.com) for use in [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/). This allows for JSON-like representations of tree data. One very useful implementation provided is a server-side file browser.

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge panel-jstree
```

or with pip

```bash
pip install panel-jstree
```

Add this into a python file to play with the FileTree

```python
from panel_jstree import FileTree

FileTree().servable()
```

run it with `panel serve name_of_app.py`

It should run exploring the directory of the file.

## üöÄ Get started in under a minute

```bash
pip install  panel-jstree
```

Run the examples

```bash
panel serve tests/*tree.py --show
```

Here are some of the examples. You can see a small FileTree app with a text field and controls to directly input a file path, and turn off and on some of the controls.

You can make a simple tree where you swap out the data.

You can also see a generic Tree app with a custom callback to generate random nodes.
