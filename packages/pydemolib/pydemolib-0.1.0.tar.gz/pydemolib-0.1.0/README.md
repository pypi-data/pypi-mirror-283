# My Library

A simple example library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pydemolib


from my_library.module1 import hello_world

print(hello_world())


Follow these steps, and youâ€™ll have your Python library ready for others to use and contribute to! If you have any specific features or topics you want to include in your library, let me know, and I can provide more detailed guidance.
