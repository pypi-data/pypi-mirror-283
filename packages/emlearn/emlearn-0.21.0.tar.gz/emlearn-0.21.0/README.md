## Installing

Install from PyPI

    pip install --user emlearn

## Usage
The basic usage consist of 3 steps:

1. Train your model in Python

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
estimator = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, max_depth=10)
estimator.fit(X_train, Y_train)
...
```

2. Convert it to C code
```python
import emlearn
cmodel = emlearn.convert(estimator, method='inline')
cmodel.save(file='sonar.h', name='sonar')
```

3. Use the C code

### Simple classifiers
```c
#include "sonar.h"

const int32_t length = 60;
int16_t values[length] = { ... };

// using generated "inline" code for the decision forest
const int32_t predicted_class = sonar_predict(values, length):

// ALT: using the generated decision forest datastructure
const int32_t predicted_class = eml_trees_predict(&sonar, length):
```

### Neural net regressor

Copy the generated `.h` file, the `eml_net.h` and `eml_common.h` into your project, then

```c
#include "nnmodel.h" // the generated code basedon on keras.Sequential

float values[6] = { ... };

const float_t predicted_value = nnmodel_regress1(values, 6);
if (predicted_value == NAN) {
    exit(-1);
}
// Process the value as needed

// Or, passing in a result array directly if more than 1 output is generated
float out[2];
EmlError err = nnmodel_regress(values, 6, out, 2);
if (err != EmlOk)
{
    // something went wrong
}
else {
    // predictions are in the out array
}
```
