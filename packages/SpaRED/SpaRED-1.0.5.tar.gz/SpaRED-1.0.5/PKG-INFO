# Library_Spared_Spackle

This repository contains all the necessary files to create a PyPI library to the SPARED and SpaCKLE contributions

This is the  README file which will contain the long description of the PiPy library. Most libraries have a README file. Mean while this file will only contain this information and will be soon updated.
