# chessanalytics_st

Graphical representation of functions from chessanalytics designed for Streamlit apps.

# NOTE.

Not all functions from chessanalytics could be presented in graphical way. Functions returning single integer or two-element list do not have huge potential 
of graphical representation. That is why the two libraries may vary a little - chessanalytics_st does not have all functions from chessanalytics, but has some that chessanalytics does not have. This library strictly focuses on streamlit and uses 'st.' functions for plotting, representing data and so on. 

# Installation.

     $ pip install chessanalytics_st


# Initializing class.

      from chessanalytics_st import CAST
      cast = CAST('path/to/file/with/games', 'username')

# How does heatmap plots look?

This is a sample heatmap of king_square_captures() with default params (colorscale set to 'plotly3', showscale set to False). Note that setting off showscale makes heatmap look more like a rect than square and less readable.

Here you can see how does the heatmap look without the title.

# TIPS AND TRICKS.

1. If you do not like how does the title look but setting it to 'None' makes the plot/heatmap look worse, set the title to " " (one space sign). 

2. If you do not like how particular funcion look but want to plot it using Streamlit, just call the function from chessanalytics library and plot it 
yourself. 

3. You can check output of almost all of the functions available in the lib here:
